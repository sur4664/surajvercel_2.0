I updated the Vercel-ready project in the canvas to include everything you asked for:

✅ TradingView webhook ingestion API (/api/webhook) that validates and saves signals.

✅ Supabase integration (server insert using service role key + public anon client for frontend).

✅ Realtime updates on the dashboard via Supabase Realtime subscriptions.

✅ Admin login using Supabase magic-link (email) flow.

✅ Signals API (/api/signals) for initial data fetch.

✅ SQL to create the signals table, plus a detailed README with Vercel env variables and deployment steps.

Where it's saved: I updated the Vercel Ready Ai Signal Dashboard canvas document (the project files are all there).
